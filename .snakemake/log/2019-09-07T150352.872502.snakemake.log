MissingOutputException in line 163 of /home/icaro/Documentos/WGCA/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
prophage_prediction/V583/prophage.tbl
prophage_prediction/V583/prophage_coordinates.tsv
prophage_prediction/V583/prophage_tbl.tsv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
