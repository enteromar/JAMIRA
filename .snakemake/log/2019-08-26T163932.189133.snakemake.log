Error in rule virulence_identification:
    jobid: 18
    output: virulence_genes/L8.tsv
    shell:
        abricate --minid=90 --db=vfdb data/samples/L8.fasta > virulence_genes/L8.tsv
        (exited with non-zero exit code)

Removing output files of failed job virulence_identification since they might be corrupted:
virulence_genes/L8.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
