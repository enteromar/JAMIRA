Missing local::lib; initializing CPAN.
Sorry, we have to rerun the configuration dialog for CPAN.pm due to
some missing parameters. Configuration will be written to
 <<_cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm>>

Your 'urllist' is already configured. Type 'o conf init urllist' to change it.

Autoconfiguration complete.

commit: wrote '_cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm'

You can re-run configuration any time with 'o conf init' in the CPAN shell
