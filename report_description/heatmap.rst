AMR genes categorised by Drug Class and samples have been clustered hierarchically (see SciPy documentation). 
Yellow represents a perfect hit, teal represents a strict hit, purple represents no hit. Genes with asterisks (*) appear multiple times because they belong to more than one Drug Class category in the antibiotic resistance ontology (ARO).
